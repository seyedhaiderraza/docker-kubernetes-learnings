Need?
If I am running my docker container-> 
.traffic can increase => we can create more containers manually => time consuming
if an image is updated with new code => need to update all other containers
this problem is solved with k8s which has a master 
=> scheduler, api layer, configMap
k8s consist of 
a Cluster consisiting of a Master + several Nodes 
Each Node => several pods + internal ips, services+external ip 
Pods run one container per pod 
each Node running service can interact with pod containers running app  using interal ip 
Each service has external ip which user can use to interact with app in  pod container
k8s - 
-manages load balancing of containers by ability to create multiple pods easily
- use yaml file to pull image and create a container running on a pod 
within yaml
-we can define service config and contianer config for image 
-internal ports, external port, app name, image to be pulled for making app


kubernetes?
a software to provide orchestration process to :
- spin up multiple containers at a time
- scale up container pods easily 
- use yaml configuration(image, app, replica no., ports etc) single file to deploy your app
- scheduler to handle loadbalancing between different replicas of containers-pod running
- api layer to use kubectl for user to interact with Master

architecture?
pod, workers, master, cluster?
Pod, Service, ingress, node ?
pod ip addres, node ip address
exposing the pods
configMap, Secret

has Clusters
    -has Master Node, worker Nodes 
        - MAster node has api layer, etcd, scheduler, etc
        - Worker Nodes
            - Have pods running containers + internal ip+port 
                -Secret yaml file containing username password
            - have docker configuration 
            - have services = abstraction w external ip+port to give interaction to user
                -ConfigMap yaml 
                    - define which app to connect to (means pod)
                    - on which port to run 
                    - on which port service app is running which connects with interal ip of app pod
                    - nodePort

minikube
: a k8s tool to create a  local cluster

to get minikube for windows:
-curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-windows-amd64.exe && mv minikube-windows-amd64.exe minikube.exe && chmod +x minikube.exe

to start minikube cluster based on k8s:
minikube start

kubectl?
- kubectl version

& create
to create a pod using nginx image:
- kubectl create depoyment nginx-depl --image=nginx

    - debug Pod
- kubectl get pod
- kubectl describe pod <podid>
- kubectl logs nginx-depl-56cb8b6d7

to go inside a running container pod:
-kubectl exec -it nginx-depl-56cb8b6d7-rbdkc -- bin/bash
    - apply
using a yaml file we use apply to create a service(service abstraction to a service pod)
 or a deployment(contianer spin up on a pod)
- kubectl apply -f ninx-deploy.yaml

    - get pods/replicas/service/all
- kubectl get all
= shows all pods, services, replicas created and running

    - get all | grep <appname>
= gets all pods/services/replicas related to only the str pattern name <appname>
- kubectl get all | grep nginx

YAML :
apiVersion |    kind |  metadata : name |   

spec | selector : matchlabels: app , replicas: |

    | template : metadata: labels: app,
    | spec : containers: name, image, ports
etc ...

Mongodb and mongo-express
deployment using k8s
-mongodb deployment file yaml
    -image, port, username, password
-mongodb service yaml (internal)
-Secret

-mongo-express deployment yaml
-mongo-express-service yaml (external)
    -image, port, internal mongodb app connect
-configMap
-(external so=>) nodePort
---------------------
Steps:
1. POD creation:
first define a YAML file for mongodb app to run on pod with internal ip
- mongo-deployment.yaml => should contain:
    - kind: Deployment            -- for container pod
    - name                        -- name of container 
    - app                         --name of app from image
    -container name, image, containerPort    -- image to pull, default port where mongodb app runs
    -env username, password
        -valueFrom
            -secretKeyRef   --secret.yaml file name and 'key' to use as value (username/password)
2. Service to Pod container:
which acts as service to interact with for another service pod to run
    -kind: Service
-metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
-spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  -ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017

3. Secret :
    containing username and password

4. mongo-express container pod to interact with mongodb DB container pod
     - kind: Service            -- for container pod
    - name                        -- name of container 
    - app                         --name of app from image
    -container name, image, containerPort    -- image to pull, default port where mongo-express app runs
    -env 
        -username, password
        -valueFrom
            -secretKeyRef   --secret.yaml file name and 'key' to use as value (username/password)
        (for configMap)
        -name: 
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
                name: mongodb-configmap
                key: database_url
5. mongo-express Service
which acts as service to interact with for another service pod to run
    -kind: Service
-metadata:
  name: mongo-express-service
-spec:
  selector:
    app: mongo-express
  -ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8081
    targetPort: 8081
    type: loadBalancer


6. ConfigMap for mong-express service:
    - kind: ConfigMap
    - name: of configmap file 
    data -> coming from database_url which is service pod of mongodb-service pod
    -database_url: mongodb-service

START deploying containers and services!

1. secret:
    kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml
2. mongodb container pod:
    kubectl apply -f mongo-deployment.yaml
3. mongodb service container pod :
     kubectl apply -f mongodb-service-deployment.yaml(sometimes within mongo-dpeloyment.yaml below --)
>>
4. configMap:
    kubectl apply -f mongo-configmap.yaml 
5. mongo-express container pod:
     kubectl apply -f mongo-express.yaml
6. mongo-express service container pod:
     kubectl apply -f mongo-express-service.yaml
CHECK?
kubectl get all | grep mongo

run app(mongo service) using minikube:
-minikube service mongo-express-service
